			<CUB3D>
				cub3D has been one of my favorite project because it's the first visual project made during my cursus.<br/>
				The project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90â€™s game Wolfeinstein. We had to reproduce some of the features of the game thanks to raycasting<br/>
			</CUB3D>
			<MINISHELL>
				Minishell was a really interesting project in wich we had to create a simple shell. we had to implement some command like echo, export, pwd, ...<br/>
