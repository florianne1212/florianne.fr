					<strong>CUB3D<br/></strong>
					This has been one of my favorite project because it's the first visual project made during my cursus.<br/>
					The project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90â€™s game Wolfeinstein. We had to reproduce some of the features of the game thanks to raycasting.<br/>
					here you can see an extract of my project.
